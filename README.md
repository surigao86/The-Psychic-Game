# The-Psychic-Game

For The-Psychic-Game I've created four words where the player is to predict what letter in the alphabet I have chosen. They will get 9 guesses. Once they have guessed it wrong 9 times it will count as a lost, but if they guess it right then it will record it as a win. 

You can win 3 times before it resets itself and if you loss 5 times it will reset itself too.

Created a reset.css from meyerweb.com

Add background color and on each each ID gave them margin and padding

Header tag has larger font size then the paragraphs
